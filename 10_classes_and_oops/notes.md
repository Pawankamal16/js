# javascript and classes

//technically classes is not inside javascript,is progg style
   
//programming style may be oops and functional

//constructor method is a special method for cretaing and intializing an object

## oops

oops is a programming paradise means what is the structure of writing your code,what style you do prefer

## object
 - collection pf properties(variable) and method
 - toLowerCase,toUpperCase, date, promise etc are objects

## why use oops

 code has much mashup before oops, in oops we use feature like serives and you can take its instances later

## parts of oops

object literal
- constructer
- prototypes
- classes
- instances (new,this)


## 4 pillars
- Abstraction  // hide the internal details,fetch remove all the details from you
- Encapsulation  //wrap the data and function together,give the acces whatever i want to do or vice versa
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism  // one methods can many work
